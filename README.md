# Bird Sound Classifications

We built implement two deep learning approaches to classify bird sounds. We used our own dataset consisting of bird sound recorded at [Intaka Island](https://intaka.co.za/) (South Africa).

## Organization

This repository contains our dataset, a notebook and a report. The the data is located in the folder Data and is structures as follows.

- `Annotations/` : contains annotation associated to each audio files. It's create using Sonic Visualizer

- `Audio/` : contains audio files recorded 

- `DataFiles/` : contains two files, `TrainingFiles.txt` is used to set the files reserved to train model
and `TestingFiles.txt` is used to set the files reserved to testing model.


The last folders is left empty for post-processing usage and saving object instances as their name suggests.

- `Model_Output/`

- `Pickled_Data/`
